    "# Seminar goals:\n",
    "In this project, we will develop and apply different supervised classification tecnhiques. These methodologies are broadly used in business to multiple use cases as:\n",
    "- identify **new customers** in the market\n",
    "- identify customers in our internal Data Warehouse with **more likely** to buy a new product\n",
    "- identify unsatisfied customers and thus, likely to be **churners**\n",
    "- classify text into categories for spam identification or to process messages or emails from our customers\n",
    "\n",
    "During this project we will follow the end-to-end Machine Learning process: from data gathering and cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and finally, training and prediction. In particular, the main sections of this project are:\n",
    "1. Data understanding and preparation: exploration of the dataset and feature engineering (missing values, outlier identification, categorical variables management) \n",
    "2. Model Training: training the baseline SVM and Decision Trees. Analysis of metrics (recall, precision, confusion metrics) and improvement the classification through several techniques as undersampling to balance or ensemble of models\n",
    "3. Creating a Business opportunity with Machine Learning: selection of the best model and identification of the most important features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will apply all these techniques to identify new customers to capture and improve sales in a **marketing use case**."

We have adjusted the main classification parameters as cutoff, recall and precision according to the final purpose: in out case, identify **non customers** that could be interested to buy our products. Consider a new campaign focused on accelerating the sales of a **New IoT tariff** to our customers. Answer the following questions:\n",
    "- In this case, which is the **target** variable? Which are **target=0** samples? And **target=1**?\n",
    "- As the marketing campaing is oriented to our customers we will have further information about them in our internal systems. In particular, we could add to the information of the previous section 3 new variables: data and voice consumption and mobile expense. Adding more data to the dataset may imply more computational data and cost. Would you add these 3 new variables to dataset? Justify your answer.\n",
    "- Today this New IoT tariff is very popular among our customers. Will the training dataset be balanced or unbalanced? Justify your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the following scatter plot (`Number of IoT devices (units)` vs `Number of IoT applications (units)`):\n",
    "\n",
    "![<scatter_plot>](scatter_plot.png)\n",
    "- Describe in terms of `Number of IoT devices (units)` and `Number of IoT applications (units)` the **pattern** of target 1 customers\n",
    "- Draw a plane to separate both classes\n",
    "- Is the training dataset balanced? Justiy your answer\n",
    "- According to the previous plane, which are the customers to be phoned to sell the New IoT tariff?\n",
    "- Could you estimate the **precision** and **recall** of the classification?"
