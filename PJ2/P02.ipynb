    "# Seminar goals:\n",
    "In this project, we will develop and apply different supervised classification tecnhiques. These methodologies are broadly used in business to multiple use cases as:\n",
    "- identify **new customers** in the market\n",
    "- identify customers in our internal Data Warehouse with **more likely** to buy a new product\n",
    "- identify unsatisfied customers and thus, likely to be **churners**\n",
    "- classify text into categories for spam identification or to process messages or emails from our customers\n",
    "\n",
    "During this project we will follow the end-to-end Machine Learning process: from data gathering and cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and finally, training and prediction. In particular, the main sections of this project are:\n",
    "1. Data understanding and preparation: exploration of the dataset and feature engineering (missing values, outlier identification, categorical variables management) \n",
    "2. Model Training: training the baseline SVM and Decision Trees. Analysis of metrics (recall, precision, confusion metrics) and improvement the classification through several techniques as undersampling to balance or ensemble of models\n",
    "3. Creating a Business opportunity with Machine Learning: selection of the best model and identification of the most important features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will apply all these techniques to identify new customers to capture and improve sales in a **marketing use case**."

    "[**EX5**] [**CODE**] Finally before entering in the training stage,  let's create a `final_dataset` that is the result of stacking `customer_dt`and `noncustomer_dt`considering the following variables: `City_coded`, `Revenue`, `Sector`, `Legal_Form_Code`, `CNT_EMPLOYEE`, `CNT_CB_DENSITY`, `CNT_CB_MOB_DENSITY`, `CNT_CB_FN_DENSITY`and `Mobile_potential`. The 'final_dataset' should include a new variable, `Target`, that takes value **0** for noncustomers and **1** for customers registers. The `Target` will distiguish the two classes to train the model."

Besides, to protect the training from **overfitting** and calculate the performance with less variance than a single train-test split, it is uselful to apply **K-Fold cross-validation**. The way that KFolds works is splitting the dataset into k-parts or **fold** (e.g. k = 3, 5 or k = 10). The algorithm is trained on k − 1 folds with one held back and tested on the held back fold."
